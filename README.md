## Project Specifications
1. STM Discovery board
• Submits accelerometer readings to the AWS cloud, through the Nucleo board and
smartphone.
• Reads data obtained from AWS cloud through Nucleo board and outputs it on the DAC.

-> Get Accelerometer Readings (RAW)

-> Send RAW data to Nucleo using UART

-> Receive Processed Data from Nucleo using UART

-> Output processed Accelerometer Data on DAC

2. STM Nucleo board with BLE board
• Interconnects Discovery board with smartphone. Provides BLE functionality to the
Discovery board.

-> Receive RAW accelerometer data from Discovery Board using UART

-> Send data to smartphone using bluetooth

-> Receive processed data from smartphone using bluetooth

-> Send processed data to Discovery board using UART

3. Smartphone
• Interconnects Nucleo and Discovery board with AWS cloud. Accesses cloud services, including the authentication. Sends processed data back to Nucleo board

-> Receive RAW accelerometer data from Nucleo using Bluetooth

-> Send raw data to aws

-> Send processed data to aws (if not using lambda)

-> Make Data available on phone display


4. AWS cloud
• Stores Discovery board data, manipulated files, makes data visible to clients on any
platform. Basic processing includes operations such as mirror-imaging of the data.
• Bonus: Performs advanced processing (such as filtering, computing pitch and roll) of the
data using Lambda functions.
